networkGen Package
==================

This package is used to generate network mazes. Currently it is at the version 0.1.0.

It can generate mazes of up to two unidirectional arrows currently in HTML templates.

More to come soon!

R/networkGen is an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package with R functions that are useful to me for automatically generating network mazes for research. These two are the most important functions in the package.

-   networkGen
    -   `netHTML`
    -   `netHTML2arrows`
